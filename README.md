# qtSerialDataPlotFFT
simple qt application that compute Real Time (Real) FFT of Data coming From Serial Port, and Plot Both Raw Data and FFT using QcustomPlot.

qt creator 4.8.5 was used to make this project .
it receive comma seperated value from serial port and plot raw data using QcustomPlot
it Also compute Realtime SDFT whenever one sample receive and update plot immediately .

if you have any problem let me know .
